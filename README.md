![Data](https://github.com/HaroldDavis3/collabora-blockstack/blob/master/collabora-blockstack-master/src/Images/Data.jpg "Data")
# Goals of This Project
  This would be an important first step in showing the transformational power of matrilineal council managed local & regional data. Through MIDs(Mediators of Individual Data) & DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) this first step can **facilitate the beginning of an important paradigm shift in both *high value data* & modes of consumption**. 
  The former will largley happen outside of this specific project; in the Collections Project of Blockstack. There, schemas can be built out as innovative commons of technology that represents a two way dialogue between developers and folks who specialize in data. Collections schemas are focused on providing data portability. These schemas can be designed to lend themselves to MIDs & important paradigm shifts in what is considred *high value data*.
  
  These same schemas can begin an important path towards a paradigm shift in end of lifecycle based consumption. Moving towards (pro)sumption based systems design and away from consumption based product design. For example, this specific repo will be integrated into this Two Row Wampum Social Layer project. Schemas that enable data portability into MIDs to be managed or governened by DAOs in this context will include a simple high value data example *language translation*(including endangered Indigenous languages); which actually overlaps with what is currently considered high value data. But this Social layer project will also include (in collaborative docs) research specific to global native modes of production & global SDGs efforts. Not unlike the data sets for language, this data can be transformed into a novel form of *high value data*. This is tangible in modest versions of todays AI tech and data sets which function as : Automated pairing rather than manual pairing of closing loops of value in sustainable systems R+D & enginering. Like language translation services, these data sets will be valauble pieces to potential services that will a critical function the mission of our Two Row Wampum social layer platform (non profit context) and SDGs efforts in general. This also represents a unique opportunity to bring this systems design into the two-way conversation of folks in app development & data--through Blockstack's opensource Collections schemas. 
  
  This can enable a tangible path towards ethical forms of data collection monetization & app monetization through management of data (local & regional MIDs,DAOs) serve as public utilities. Data specialists & App developers in web 3.0 who adopt a systems design approach in this context can build apps and data services that serve critical roles in production, manufacturing, or distribution of prosumption based models. All data can be client side and encrypted for all involved in the systems model.
  
# Example: **Prosumption based Systems Design Approach to MakeUp (Kits) Design**

#Video ^^^
- **Production Facing**: AI/Data sets services & IoTs help optimize sustainable modes of production  needs of local & regional raw materials for MakeUp kits(regenerative **not** extractive, hence the AI for closed loops of value circulation!). App developers should also see responsibilities that come with building apps beyond surface levels of new landsccapes of revenue streams. Afterall these apps will be capable of onboarding, training, organizing, & managing **people and ecosystems**; along with securing the data of those people & ecosystems doing said production labor and or engineering.
- **Manufacturing Facing**: AI/Data sets services & IoTs help optimize sustainable modes of manufacturing(regenerative **not** extractive, hence the AI for closed loops of value circulation!) of local & regional fabrication for MakeUp kits. Again here oppurtunity is presented along side an imperative responsibility. App developers should  see responsibilities that come with building apps beyond surface levels of-- new landsccapes of revenue streams. Afterall these apps will be capable of onboarding, training, organizing, & or managing **people and ecosystems**; along with securing the data of those people & ecosystems doing said production labor and or engineering.
- **Distribution Facing**: Here app devs and folks in data get the combined opportunity and responsibilty of reshaping supply chains and bringing in a paradigm shift away from end of life consumption through carefully designed systems approaches appropriate to varying circumstances of geographies & demographics.

**A Three Tiered Approach to Monetization of Prosumption Makeup Customer or System Base**

- **Least (Pre)fabricated Kit**- A lot of Production & Manufacturing happens as part of customer/system experience. Some models may even want to incorporate a home artisan model for production approaches altogether. R+D for Humane, human scale fabrication machines is within the scope of the production facing piece of any given system. Supply chain approaches would vary per model but should always be designed with both human and non human(ecosystems) contributors involved in mind. Hybridity over universitality will be key to supply chain solutions in this context. Supply chins representing yet another avenue for IoT app creation in this context; *Unique combinations of both low & innovative high tech slow supply chain approaches may become a new standard.*

- **Partially (Pre)fabricated Kit**- For a more intermediate prosumption experience or education as a member of a local system. These kits are made for a smooth prosumption experience. Some production & manufacturing happens as part of customer/system experience. For those that wish to incorporate a home artisan kind of model into their system, this may serve as a viable onboarding & training means that can put todays gig apps onboarding & skills training models to shame. In this latter case any machine R+D done in above tier can be utilized in this tier; making conditions ripe for innovation as customers/system members move between tiers.   

- **Most (Pre)fabricated Kit**- For a beginner's prosumption experience or education as a member of a local system. These kits are made for the smoothest prosumption experience, while emphasizing the consideration of all aspects of the full lifecycle, labor & supply chain(human & nonhuman) in the system the in which the kit was produced. Little production & manufacturing happens as part of customer/system experience; but just enough to give a sweet taste of furthering your prosumption system experience as an active participant. Incentives and benefits designed to make any given base interested in much more than surface level incentives like a new landscape of better paying gig economy or new end of life consumption opportunity; but rather a way toward bottom up sustainable sytems building.

# What the Above looks like in Context of Our Social Layer Mission

# Away from Conventional Industrial Extraction & Towards Artisanal & Indigenous Modes of Production
![indigenousmodes](https://github.com/HaroldDavis3/collabora-blockstack/blob/master/collabora-blockstack-master/src/Images/indigenousmodes.jpg "indigenousmodes")
The model described above can be Extrapolated across fields & disciplines to create a tangible path away from conventional industrial extraction & towards artisanal & indigenous modes of production. This wide breadth of said novel monetization landscapes for those in Data or app development represents yet another opportunity & responsibility to build a viable ethical alternative to the ugly ecosystem of data monetization under web 2.0's surface; which is so comprehensive that it requires a wicked alternative equally as comprehensive. The infrastructure for which can be actively built starting immediately via model description above & Blockstack's Collections project. (Imperative to all the above working is ~governance~ which in an indigenous bottom up organization approach is better termed-**management**. For Better understanding of this, we recommend our [Two Row Wampum Social Layer Platform Whitepaper](https://github.com/HaroldDavis3/Two-Row-Wampum-Social-Layer-Platform) latest draft can be easily viewed here:[website](https://socialayerdraft.netlify.com/) to learn & participate in the Legal *Indigenous Constitution* & proper relationship to the western hemisphere only accessible through the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty).

# App Chains & A Path Toward Indigenous Modes of Transaction & Trade
![PoX](https://github.com/HaroldDavis3/collabora-blockstack/blob/master/collabora-blockstack-master/src/Images/StacksChain.jpg "StacksChain")
The coming functionality of the Stacks chain from Blockstack will enable chains to be built atop of the existing Stacks chain. The same means of doing so, through a recent concensus algorithm proposal PoX(Proof of Transfer) will enable chains to be built atop of said new chains. A current draft of Token Economics for our mission in the Two Row Wampum Social Layer platform will explicitly state that the building of our first chain will be soley as a means to build a NFT chain(NonFungibleToken). This last chain will not function in a non-native economics context but in an indigenous modes of transaction i.e barter & trade context. Distinct from modern economic systems; this approach to regulated and managed trade is based in an never ending effort to establish **balance** between autonomous entities who have agreed to Peace in all interactions with one another as well as ecosystems in which they live.
![Onakora1.0](https://github.com/HaroldDavis3/collabora-blockstack/blob/master/collabora-blockstack-master/src/Images/Onakora1.0.jpg "Onakora1.0")
The ultimate goal will be to get back to producing physical Onakora as a means to transactions & trade. The first chain while fungible(for time needed until self sufficiency of second chain), will function similar to non profit models; building out a Native Matrilineal council managed corridor of trade that follows native protocols of bottom up organization & consensus decision making. We have access to a Traditional council with unique jurisprudence which may make legal Nation level approval of blockchains & novel exchange structures innovations based in indigenous modes of production & trade, easier for our platform than others. But no worries the corridor is accessible to all who want to be involved in the proper relationship to the hemisphere! All that is needed is **DIALOGUE** through the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty & working group council! The model described in above sections extrapolated across fields of artisinal crafts & indigenous modes of production; will constitute how app/service specific chains can act as an authentic non profit public expressive commons for our mission of the Two Row Wampum Social Layer. First attracting chain support via enabling important R+D in global SDGs efforts(with added protections against modern iterations of colonialism)open to all; but then grow organically into autonomous, self sustaining systems, as our systems protypes & PoCs will envoke a *living research* approach.

# Public Utility App Chain Status
Blockstack has paved an important path toward approaches to blockchain models.The models described in above sections make sure to leverage work done by Blockstack PBC in the way of aquiring public utility status from the SEC. This will be a valuable tool in the way of our corridor of indigenous trade efforts in the TRW social layer mission and to those interested in involving their efforts via non profit efforts that can constitute the beginning of necessary paradigm shifts in both data collection/app creation/monetization.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Special Thanks to Original Repo: Animal Kingdom Sample app
This sample app allows a user to create their own animal kingdom. They create their own
animal persona and then populate their kingdom with rulers or subjects of other kingdoms
either on the same app or on other forks of this app.
To add an animal to your kingdom, you can enter the animal's URL into the box.
Each app can have different animals and territories. Animals and territories that only exist
in one instance of this app (a "planet") can be used in other instances.
You can browse kingdoms on other instances and forks of this apps from the other kingdom section.
## How this works
Information about each animal and the subjects in a kingdom is loaded from
the creating user's Gaia storage. Images of the animal persona and territories
are loaded from the instance of the app where they were created.
## Developer customization
Developers can fork this app and add their own custom animal and territory types to
their fork. They can also add their custom instance of this app to the list of "Other Kingdoms"
in the app by sending a pull request to the repo.
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
### Deployment
If you are deploying this, you'll need to set cores headers to allow requests from all
hosts otherwise you won't be able to sign in and other apps won't be able to load
your animal and kingdom information.
This code includes deployment settings for Firebase and Netlify in the `cors` directory:
| Service  	| Files                      	|
|----------	|----------------------------	|
| Firebase 	| firebase.json, .firebaserc 	|
| Netlify  	| _headers, _redirects       	|
If you're deploying this on another service, you'll need to set CORS headers appropriately for that service.
